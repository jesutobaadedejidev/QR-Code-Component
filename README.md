## My process

I started with studying the design using figma and creating a similar design using the one given as a template. Then I went on to code the design with HTML. When I was done with HTML, I moved on to styling with CSS, using the font-family,font-sizes and colors that were given.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to use figma for UI designs and how to properly translate designs to code using figma.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development
